# CVNLab
Work done in CVNLab

The work can be broadly divided into 
1) Data Exploration Analyses - NSD 
2) Stimuli Annotation Efforts - NSD
3) Exploratory modeling of the responses (PCA, pRF and Ridge Regression) - NSD
4) Data Exploration Analyses - NSD Synthetic

Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) is a large scale, high field fMRI dataset collected at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. You can check out more about it here: http://naturalscenesdataset.org/

The matrices repindmat and repmat contain the ordering of the Stimulus images and the trials shown to the subjects and they are commonly used in most of the following analyses hence they are present here. 

### NSD Data Exploration Analyses
The codes are primarily in the NSD_Data_Exploration folder.

### NSD Stimuli Annotation Efforts 
The codes used in the quantification and the processing of annotations can be found in the Image_Annotation_Preprocessing folder and Stim_Annotation_Analyses folder. The final product is the NSD Extension present at the bottom of the NSD Website, which can be downloaded using: http://naturalscenesdataset.org/NSD_FaceWordAnnotations_1.0.zip

### NSD Exporatory Modeling Efforts
The codes used for these analyses can be found in NSD_pRF and PCA folders.

### NSD Synthetic Data Exploration
The codes utilised for these analyses are in the NSD_Synthetic folder.
